# Nyx
Yet Another Cloud Storage Service!

Nyx is a cloud storage service that aims to offer multiple advantages over other services:
- Flexibility in terms of storage plans and the ability to resize at any time
- Offer File Sharing with access control settings and edit/view options
- File previews for all file types, with support for editing on the fly for files which support it

The plan is to write Nyx from scratch. We plan on using AWS services for storage and their API for operations
